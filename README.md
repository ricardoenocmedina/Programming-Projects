# Ricardo Medina's Programming Projects
The purpose of this repository is to display the programming projects that I have made over the years. The following  were either **passion projects**, conceived out of a desire to learn more about the nuances of programming, or as **school projects**, made with plenty of forethought to put my coding knowledge to the test.

If you have any questions about me or my projects, feel free to reach out to me. My email is: ricardo.medina.enoc@gmail.com
